#Problem Statement:
Develop a robust system for data compression using advanced data structures and algorithms. This system will represent file contents with a data structure like a Huffman coding tree to generate efficient compression codes. Algorithms such as Huffman coding needs to be implemented to perform the compression and decompression of data.
